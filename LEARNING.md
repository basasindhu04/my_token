# What I Learned

Through this ERC-20 token project, I learned:

- How token balances are stored using mappings
- How the transfer and approval mechanisms work internally
- How allowances help with delegated transfers
- How to test functions in RemixIDE
- How to deploy contracts and interact with events
- How to organize a smart contract project with GitHub

This project improved my understanding of Solidity and ERC-20 token standards.
